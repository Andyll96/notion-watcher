Rough Goals (temporary location until I can create issues)
 - Get rough version of code working
 - optimize
 - make sure uv environment is setup correctly
 - test running code on raspberry pi
 - setup with docker container
 - implement CI/CD workflow with Github Actions
 - Potentially create some sort of web interface to monitor notion-watcher logs
